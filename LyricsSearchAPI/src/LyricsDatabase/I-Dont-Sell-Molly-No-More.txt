I Donâ€™t Sell Molly No More
iLoveMakonnen

[Hook]
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean

[Verse 1]
OG pimping, trench coat mobbing
Money keep flowing from the Bity to Bompton
West coast Makonnen, the best thing going
They really like my movies, it's the best thing showing
Boss Hogg playing, competition slaying
Sell the whole pack then relax before the day end
Making hella, mula', give a damn about your jeweler
Shouts out west Baltimore and free young moolah

[Hook]
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean

[Verse 2]
Haters can't see us, Nish or Taniya
We be in L.A. posting like the coliseum
Big smoking, PCH coasting
Sherantino Hotel, pent house toasting
When Straw-ber-ita dreams turn to champagne reality
Old friend been down since New Life Academy
Now we bound to the dough, it all make sense
Own our own homes, we ain't gotta pay rent

[Hook]
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean

[Outro]
Gas
Don't sell molly no more
I keep the white though
And it gotta be a pint though
