[Intro: Playboi Carti]
Gas in my blunt
(I can't go in, I ain't ready)
Lean in my cup, what the fuck?
(Fetti on fetti on fetti)
Uh
(I can't go in, I ain't ready, fetti on fetti)
(808 Mafia)
Money bags, yeah, uh
Money bags, nigga, uh
Fetti on fetti on fetti
Fetti on fetti on fetti
Fetti on fetti on fetti (Yeah, yeah)
(8-8-8-808 Mafia)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I'm still pouring up
I can see in his face, designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face, that ho give me faith
Damn, that ho give me face
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain’t ready
Fetti on fetti

[Verse 1: Da$H]
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready, that drank on me heavy
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready, them pills kicking heavy
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready, that .40 too heavy
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready, just count up my fetti
So
Yeah, So
Mister Never-Lackin', bust a package
Bills can get paid off of rappin', still I keep to trappin'
Used to hunnid sack it, now I fuck a actress
Shit, I'm just thinkin' how it happened
Had to get explicit, had to make 'em listen
Movin' out them pounds, niggas started snitchin'
Loadin' up them rounds, niggas started missin'
Move it out of town, and Tommy Cruise the mission
Converse with my 'dictions, don't talk, I just listen
Five drugs that I'm mixin', money only thing on my vision
Infatuated with them semis and 'matics
All of my niggas is thugs with some habits
Like grandma TV we been with the static
I fuck on this bitch and she say she from Athens
Opiated so I'm demonstratin' my emotion less
Got some real niggas quotin' this, got yo' main bitch holdin' shit
Lost a few things as of recent, life anything but decent
When we re-up on my teeth it's the only time you catch me cheesin', it's Dolla

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I'm still pourin' up
I can see in his face, designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face, that ho give me faith (Damn)
That ho give me face
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can't go in, I ain't ready, I can't go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on fetti

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Shippin' a pack and it's vacuum sealed
30 on 40, keep that concealed
Just bought a pint, I'ma crack the seal
Strap on my side like a Navy SEAL
Three in the morning, we trappin' still (Trap)
Matte black on rover, the Batmobile
Don’t trust that nigga cause he gon' squeal
Not buyin' shit if the pack not sealed
I'm faded, I’m faded, off Xannies I’m wasted
My bitches they nasty, they suck it and taste it
I’m short on my patience, I’m servin' my patient
I’m very impatient, lil bitch come get naked
Pack comin' in but I don’t need to weigh it
Chopper en route, I shoot once and shit sprayin'
Can’t come in my trap, the front door is gated
My prices inflated, my plug name is David
Drippin' through the city got a little bitch in Babee'Os
Fucked me on the spot 'cause she heard me on the radio
Three bitches, one of me, that's a perfect ratio
Don’t wanna fuck the ho, I just want fellatio
Let her play with the nut, put it in her bootyhole
Pop a couple pills and I beat it like a stereo
Stuffed cup, Backwoods, ridin' 'round, merry-go
Cup need a oil change, Actavis I love to pour
Hit a stain, hoggin' lanes, grippin' grain, gettin' throwed
Leave you brains in the grain, you another John Doe
No holds barred, when you see me I'ma let it go
No mo' 'gars so we rollin' up the fronto (Fo fo fo fo fo!)
No mo 'gars 'cause we rollin' out the fronto
I'm in H-Town, nigga, and I can never go

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
Lean in my cup, gas in my blunt
Got some hoes who gon' fuck
I’m still pouring up
I can see in his face, designer on my waist
Now you all in her face
That ho give me face, that ho give me faith
Damn, that ho give me face
Fetti on fetti on fetti
I can’t go in, I ain't ready, I can’t go in, I ain't ready
I can’t go in, I ain't ready, fetti on fetti on fetti
I can’t go in, I ain't ready, I can’t go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on fetti

[Outro: Playboi Carti]
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
I just left Houston, I just left Earth
I can’t go in, I ain't ready, I can’t go in, I ain't ready
Fetti on fetti
