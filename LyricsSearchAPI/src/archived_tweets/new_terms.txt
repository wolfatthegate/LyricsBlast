Woke up in the third quarter lookin' for the smoke
Rolls Royces, dope boys, Sway interviews
With a pocket full of weed inside the white house
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky
With a cleaver and  a 30, and some twisted weed
Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Weed always on my mind
I got dank shit in my cup
Blow, weed, X and we sipping on that juicy-juice
Blow, weed, coke, pop X

See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only..., I don't want to say only right, but shit... Only logic, by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found – You know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucka to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; level three, level four drug, shit like that.
Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah.

You know what, I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him. Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then you move in a sex offender, hahaha. Then give me a paper, haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.

Smokin' on big weed keyed the Cali way
Better keep a K
I sleep with a K and a couple grenades
Percs, weed, even my balance
Some bomb head? A bag of weed? (Bomb head, yeah)
That girl is smoking
4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?
That girl is smoking
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't cop the best weed
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed

Shotgun and shorty lift 'em like the potent in my joint
Barrels smoking like Red Auerbach

Rollin' up weed in public (in public)
Noname off the drugs, Noname quit the weed
Everything is everything, a cigarette for wedding ring
Noname off the drugs, Noname quit the weed
He said lean, you want to hit it, dawg?
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
And trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five
And "Weed's not a drug," that's denial
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
That rush, that drug, that dope
She wants Netflix and chill and to light weed
She got Dollars, Nut, and Alcohol all over her T&A
I smoke O's, I sip Ace, I pop whole Xanies straight
I got moonrock, molly, ecstasy, inside this weed, it's laced
I smoke doobies, don't smoke J's
I got moonrock, molly, ecstasy, inside this weed, it's laced

Your skull crack, then we crowned you
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder
That smoke green, that's Marley
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
So I sold weed and crack, merged the business
And I don’t owe these niggas nothing
Ass up, face down, puff, pass the weed around
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
A big black motherfucker with G, ya' see
So gimme a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
The E and J and ginger ale
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me

Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave
Take that coke to the stove

Everything purple, all I see is weed smoke
Smoke a blunt or two or three just to keep me straight
Pass it in a circle, everybody smoking good
On the daily might, smoke an ounce just to fuck around

100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams "The Battlefield"
"The Battlefield" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.

BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?
The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago “symphony”, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.
Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T
40. Pusha T "Lunch Money"
What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.

32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T "Move That Dope"
Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.
 Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.
After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in "Multiply." The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room
Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.

With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.
The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!
Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not "down with" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.

Molly and the Henny got me speaking different language
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
I roll up to the face, sometimes I don't share, I smoke alone

I keep it at my crib, come smoke some pack with Wiz

Flying on a cocaine spaceship (And y'all know I'm high as fuck)
Stick to rappin' 'bout the bitches, money, cars and cocaine
There’s a cost to be a boss they can’t clearly afford

I said, "What are you doing in the White House if you're not selling cocaine?
Will I get shot by a dope fiend
She's the kind of girl that make your knees go crack
When your father smokes coke and your mother's a freak
And fuck you punk 'cause you still can’t rap
Nie wiem, Schwesta Ewa, Honey Cocaine, Tyga
Built a house wit' cocaine wit' my wrist game
Built a house wit' cocaine wit' my wrist game

Takeoff got that A-1 dope whip game, Mrs. Campbells
Built a house wit' cocaine wit' my wrist game
Built a house wit' cocaine wit' my wrist game
Cocaine and water create it, in the kitchen I'm making them babies
Run wit' the pack then I'm cuttin' yo' throat, before I buy coke, I gotta get quote
They think that I'm surfin', my dope is so gnarly
Lil' Daryll whip, my dope is retarded
They think that I'm surfin', my dope is so gnarly

I'm slam dunkin' bricks they call me Amar'e

Stick up the dope man, y'all know what the fuck I'm about
Let's smoke a bundle of embalming fluid
With coke and cash in the crib, probably trees
Don't matter if it's crack, heroin or trees
Hiding the kilo of cocaine in a bucket of chicken
My man says I'm a smoking gun
Cocaine kid with a bad bite
Cocaine kid with a bad bite
Cocaine kid with a bad bite
I first tasted cocaine in 10th grade
Loud packs and molly powder all these niggas pushin' out
The realest niggas that I know ain't never sold dope
Cigarette burns on my skin, they leak puss
I'm in hell, I can't escape, cocaine smell like fish fillet
Robbers, killers, cocaine dealers
Because we know that all the bad bitches smoke (vibe wit me)
Cocaine white suits, see an angel before we murk him
I text her at the crack of dawn, tap-tap it and send her back
See the homies, I'mma holla, nothing changed I rolled a blunt
I got that crack and I got that X R E, AK
Everybody on the floor or they K'd
I am cooked cocaine, you are softer than chalk
Yo, weed flow is the best sport
I got that crack and I got that X R E, AK
I'm a G, I'm a G, I'm a G
Me and Hoody talkin' cocaine

So if you're selling crack or if you're selling rap

Dus de man ben ik en jij gewoon een nicht zoals de dochter van m'n tante is (dochter van m'n tante is)
Heb wel VWO gedaan, maar ik trek te veel op met m'n negers
Een dunne jongen maar 'k kan stampen
Ik kom barba hard en ik kom barba dope
Net zo echt als junkies aan de crack
Dus de man ben ik en jij gewoon een nicht zoals de dochter van m'n tante is (dochter van m'n tante is)
Heb wel VWO gedaan, maar ik trek te veel op met m'n negers
I finish beats like a period, don’t take no breaks, if I do it's to count up my commas
Cocaine flow, it sounds like I snorted
St. Ides and the blunt, I be getting fucked up
St. Ides and the blunt, I be getting fucked up
She said something bout Mary, I'm on Lucy, she on Molly
Smoke, I'mma dick em' down, down
12 feet when I smoke that shit
I'm 12 feet when I smoke that shit
St. Ides and the blunt, I be getting fucked up
St. Ides and the blunt, I be getting fucked up
Cocaine regime, peace to Cobain
Triple G's, speak for the lonely, speak for the needy
St. Ides and the blunt, I be getting fucked up
St. Ides and the blunt, I be getting fucked up
But the weed aroma is like a boulder
Got a cup full of drank and a blunt filled with dank dank dank
St. Ides and the blunt, I be getting fucked up

Of cocaine, it was plain and simple
And yes, I know that they're talking about cocaine and that cocaine is code-named as "white girl" sometimes, and yes, Miley Cyrus is white, but see that's the thing: it's not called Miley Cyrus, no, it's called "Hannah Montana", Make no mistake, they specifically wanted to draw more Google searches based solely on the fact that this is a rap song named after a kids' T.V. show character as a reference to something that's adult-themed. And that just comes across as attention whorish to me. That's like making a song that goes:
Back in the day when a nigga sell dope
*l o n g  a s s  p a u s e...*
Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain’t even know it
"It was a misunderstanding with the lyric, a misinterpretation where the term rape wasn’t used. I would never use the term rape. So I wanted to reach out to all the queens, all the sexy ladies, the beautiful ladies that have been reaching out to me with this misunderstanding."
*l o n g  a s s  p a u s e...*
One of my niggas got rich off coke
One of my niggas on molly, need help
One of my niggas got rich off coke
Most of my niggas done sold cocaine
One of my niggas on molly, need help
One of my niggas got rich off coke

I got model money, show money, plus I’m gettin’ that dope money
I ain’t that old, but my bank roll keep a fleet of young hoes
Smokin’ on the big ‘dro, they cook dope
I ain’t that old, but my bank roll keep a fleet of young hoes
Smokin’ on the big ‘dro, they cook dope
Homie ain’t got a cent to his name, he ain’t got money
He a lame, ain’t no one to blame, got cocaine money
Homie ain’t got a cent to his name, he ain’t got money
He a lame, ain’t no one to blame, got cocaine money

So much molly, I done took so much molly
I can’t even feel my body
So much molly, I can’t feel my body
I can’t even feel my body

Caught a Fed case with the cocaine
I cooked the dope while she count the commas
Bubble gum in the blunt, bump, bump, bump
Feel the cocaine that I snorted
You can probably smell the weed when we ride by
In my six-four smokin' San Francisco shit
Still sippin' coke with the Captain Morgan
Ik morste veel broer en nu is heel m'n hart verknoeid

Yo, I gave cocaine to users, and okays to shooters (I did)
When you this dope, it take least 50 mil' just to sit me still (Ah)
Hall N Nash and Benny like James Worthy, Kareem and Magic (Yeah)
They like "Who that? Who that spending all that dope?"
The panorama's all white, I'm on my cocaine flow
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta, yeah, hey)
Mixin' weed with the Henny, got me cross-faded
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
I been sippin' lean, tryna slow me down
I'm just a kid not old enough to smoke a cig
Spilt my lean, it got me heated

One look at it and she can’t stop lookin'
Girl Scout swag, she ain’t sellin' cookies
Don’t shoot me down, baby girl, I’m like cupid
The music loud, she was talkin' low, I couldn’t understand this ho
Don’t say a word, just grab your bag so we can disappear
She don’t drink lean, but she smoke loud
But I don’t know yet
Come lay yo head on my lap and do somethin' you barely don’t do
She don’t drink lean, but she smoke loud
I be with the gang, sippin' purple lean, switchin' lanes
Smoke a blunt now I'm back at it

Got weed on my fingers, got me on my speakers
Got lean on the seat of the Lam' bruh
Got weed on my fingers, got me on my speakers
Got lean on the seat of the Lam' bruh

So why don't you relax? Lean back and enjoy yourself
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Well it's shortage on the drank, I can't find no lean
With my K on my side, I'm ready to ride
You can open up the pop, and let the smoke come out
I be flying on a plane, but the dope is on the ground
Go'n head, pour up, roll a few O's up, let's go
Put 'em on lean, yeah, they whippin' them new machines, yeah
Pop one Perc', then you lean like kickstand

So can I lean on you?

Yeah, yeah, we gon' rock like crack when it came in
Hollow! Glad you could make it… it’s just sad he won’t make it
At these tapings, they don’t even show the show dancers
Hollow! Glad you could make it… it’s just sad he won’t make it
At these tapings, they don’t even show the show dancers
This is a interview with a vampire, you don’t know that high stakes
I don’t know what they must think
I can’t picture the Don king, but he good for promotion
The Texas slang, the drinkin' lean
But you lightnin' with the jab, but the footage can’t be found
Excuse me, don’t confuse me, your new gear dirty, nigga
But you wouldn’t know, 'cause you don’t have a car
Hold up, hold up, I can’t do this, he a Black Panther
He can craft rhymes out the air and he don’t rehearse it
He can disable a bomb and he won’t get nervous — he’s perfect!
He can craft rhymes out the air and he don’t rehearse it
He can disable a bomb and he won’t get nervous — he’s perfect!
He can bury a meteor and it won’t resurface — he’s perfect!

He can bury a meteor and it won’t resurface — he’s perfect!
But legends don’t choke on purpose
He can bury a meteor and it won’t resurface — he’s perfect!
But legends don’t choke on purpose
Legends don’t choke: picture Jordan game 6, 4th quarter
And him passin' it to Ron Harper… legends don’t choke
Legends don’t choke: picture Jordan game 6, 4th quarter
And him passin' it to Ron Harper… legends don’t choke
You couldn’t find nothin' to rhyme with hospital bed?
Why you didn’t just freestyle off the top—
I know crack was rough out there in the 80's
But don’t be depressed about your best
I know crack was rough out there in the 80's
But don’t be depressed about your best
As if Nasty wasn’t enough
He didn’t even have the rest of the money
Don’t cheat yourself, the streets is swell
You don’t even help out with that rent up in the Bronx
You can’t match snatch opposite rap operators
You can’t negotiate the big brother with black hostages
This don’t make good sense
You can’t negotiate the big brother with black hostages
This don’t make good sense
Car lighters don’t go in like this heart fighter
When I give a nigga this work it ain't Ma$e returnin'
That nigga soft — see, I don’t get this shit
Like, "Woo! I don’t know, it just sounded hot."
Because you don’t understand him it don’t mean that he nice
Like, "Woo! I don’t know, it just sounded hot."
Because you don’t understand him it don’t mean that he nice
Because you don’t understand him, it don’t mean that he’s nice
He tell his boys, "I can’t comfortably sleep
I don’t want to be stuck in fatigue
He tell his boys, "I can’t comfortably sleep
I don’t want to be stuck in fatigue
'Cause you don’t understand him it don’t mean that he’s nice
You know the reason why I don’t respect your flow?
'Cause you don’t understand him it don’t mean that he’s nice
You know the reason why I don’t respect your flow?
I mean, can’t you see that he’s fake?
'Cause he can’t sell any of his CD's and tapes
And takes you to that place… that isn’t there
It’s Lux! You don’t get what he’s sayin', dummy?
Lux got bars — see, but I don’t get this shit
Look at him like, “You can’t be serious!”
Is slow down your sentences, don’t forget and remember it
Wait! I can’t say this to Lux!
Oh, what I’m tryin' to tell you, P.S. don’t rush your delivery
We couldn’t shoo him, he was in his prime
But now that we don’t get his rhymes
We couldn’t shoo him, he was in his prime
But now that we don’t get his rhymes
Oh, y'all didn’t know? He said I stay at Mom's house
Hold up, don’t stop my sale, Beloved
Promethazine, codeine, morphine, it doesn’t motivate
Make no mistake about this: if you ever been around someone on heroin, they’re a dependant
The whole body readjust and you just can’t end it
'Cause you said you stopped drinkin' lean in October
Wow! The brain disease you can’t seem to knock out
You a bad weed, and this a travesty; and this one casualty
They don’t put us on to the system, I assist 'em
I just see what you don’t see, Hollow, I’m statin' the facts
But don’t even thank me for that
'Cause you can’t even see fast your last drank of that batch
You make the fans see me as greedy, as if I broke some treaty because I don’t let 'em treat me like a 'don'
Man up, 'cause stand-up niggas don’t lean!
You give it to him, but don’t show him how you got it
That’s why I wore this image, so you don’t forget to remember
They can’t deny, the answers lie
It’s sad, 'cause some minds you can’t remind
'Cause you won’t take more money from rap
I got plans for the youth, you tryin' to lean on me?
But they can’t mix problems with bad guesses
You don’t understand that when you reproduce
You probably didn’t speak to Obama before the speech
Don’t you niggas ever throw rocks at the sun, you can’t reach it
You talk about me sippin' lean
I admit what I do to them, I don’t gotta lie to y'all, G
He probably was on the set on the low, tryna dog lean
I admit what I do to them, I don’t gotta lie to y'all, G
He probably was on the set on the low, tryna dog lean
I can’t get this work, I got a criminal record
So don’t think singles, think Pringles
He talkin' about Lean On Me
He said: “Brother, I wasn’t feelin' that fight
And we don’t wanna hear that bullshit, Sharif!
We don’t wanna hear what Jesus did
Nigga, we don’t even know if you follow religious tradition
I don’t know, is you pickin'?
But couldn’t clear his ties with the 10% Smack was offerin'
Alright, let me get up out this church, don’t look at me sideways
You couldn’t beat me if it was two of you
Kid Capri said you was greedy and wouldn’t give him cash
And wouldn’t give him cash. Facts!
Nigga, you don’t have custody of your son
'Cause you don’t file taxes
Nigga, you don’t have custody of your son
'Cause you don’t file taxes
For your lil man you’d put that talkin' to the side
Now his son is inhalin' second-hand smoke
'Cause he don’t wanna hear his moms get fucked
And you can’t go to the wake? I ain't think so
'Cause over drama it don’t matter who kid that K slay
I could've got the 4-9 and spray, but I’m fantastic with the K
Hollow! Glad you could make it… it’s just sad he won’t make it
At these tapings, they don’t even show the show dancers
I can’t picture the Don king, but he good for promotion
But you wouldn’t know, 'cause you don’t have a car
He can craft rhymes out the air and he don’t rehearse it
He can disable a bomb and he won’t get nervous — he’s perfect!
He can bury a meteor and it won’t resurface — he’s perfect!

But I couldn’t bear the thought of leavin' her
That I didn’t have all the facts
But I couldn’t bear the thought of leavin' her
Aim my boombox at the roof, I'm playing "Lean On Me"
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me

I don't pop Xans, I don't drink lean, you're my drug
I'm 'bout to smash out, lean out the window with rags out, yeah, yeah
We slang that K, then it's blood on the pavement
That choppa roll a nigga up like dope
I'm pourin' lean 'til I can't pour no more
Murder runnin' through my veins like heroin in a needle
No homie, this ain't lean, I'm drinkin' lemonade
I beat the pot with the spoon and watch the dope lock up
I'm booted up, Molly Jolly, I don't need coffee
I'm booted up, Molly Jolly, I don't need coffee

She got a mean bop, I got a lean to the way I walk
She got a mean bop, I got a lean to the way I walk
She got a mean bop, I got a lean to the way I walk
Golden rays of sun grow my dope
Going for the gold 'fore a G get old and his heart grow cold
I see these dope boys had shit right all along
She got a mean bop, I got a lean to the way I walk
Oh, you had a man now you don't , now you don’t
Recluse, sippin' on some lean I would let loose
While you're riding a couple dope rides
I smoke motherfucker, I lean dawg
You know the weed smoke, Sour diesel
And I keep a blunt rolled of that fuckin' bomb haze
Say a nigga can't smoke here, then fuck you
And I keep a blunt rolled of that fuckin' bomb haze

Let’s be honest, you ain’t gotta lie
Shoulda never gave a nigga money, man pour me
Just pour me up, higher, I’m sippin lean like I’m on a fuckin diet
Now it ain’t hard to tell by the way you’ve been lookin at her face

I was just smokin' on doja
Y el día que me quieran dar, cabrón tú dame un call
Si te toca, te toca y te mueres
Me bajan los kilos de Cali todos los catorces y los veintiochos
Somos glotones, y aunque cumplan años no parto el bizcocho

Y tengo como ocho llamadas perdi'as del gerente 'el banco
Te secuestro y te mato
Y te ponemo' el casco, cabrón, donde van los zapatos
Yo sigo viajando, cobrando sin tener que firmar con nadie contrato y papeles
Yo tengo 18 y al Diablo yo me amarré
Y tengo mil guerreros loco de poner a sangre correr
Te van a matar, y te va a caer en la red de Sabana Gardens

If you wanna be a dope dealer
Sipping on purple potion, take away all the emotions (Lean!)

Lotta smoking, drinking, that's the shit I'm on
Heard you smoke blunts, you down with paper planes or nah?
Forced trauma; blunt
The world ain’t finished swallowing my wad
My blunt full of B.C
Watering brain cell is a daily routine, kiss to a blunt
So don’t forget my name, don't forget my team
Don’t believe your man, he ain't making no money
Don’t forget to never forget
I got no time to do what I don’t want to do
I got no time to do what I don’t want to do

Hop in the G ride
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack

If we don’t give them martyrs no more, they can’t defeat us
But veterans don’t get the benefit of feelin' at home

Causes men to suffocate, I can’t breathe no more
Is like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers

And the process may teach you e lesson you seem to have missed
I’d like nothing better than bringing him the man!
Resign to him; and his blunt yoke has broken

See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "That’s my shit!"
The second I jump on a stage, I’m rocking it, ain’t nobody stoppin'
Whoever goes on after me, I’m sorry, you ain’t topping it
Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "That’s my shit!"
Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
D to the M to the X
Never heard that D be runnin', because D be gunnin'
And if they get me with the joint, they hit me with a three-to-nine
D to the M to the X
Never heard that D be runnin', because D be gunnin'
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Investigatin' the joint for traps
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Smokin' my brain into mush
Now I smoke pounds of the kush
I'll smoke a dub in the tub
Fuck joint custody, I need a joint right now
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip (King Crack)
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Went from posted on stoops (Stoops,) to smokin' on roofs (Roofs)
This name says "Crack dealin' trap nigga slash cap peeler
Get your own smoke, get your own bitch
It's straight from Cali, that's what's in my joint that's what I'm puffin', OG
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Blast 'em and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Blast 'em and pass her her glass of Ol' E
But I don’t, no matter how good it gets, it’ll never be like before
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
Now go get my throne, 'cause I don’t wanna stop
From the D, coppin' in Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
Now go get my throne, 'cause I don’t wanna stop
From the D, coppin' in Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley
This a will.i.am joint
But, she don’t really know shit, so I gotta show the ho
Smokin’, drinkin’, no passin’ out
Disrespect me, knock him out, crack a smile, Pacquiao
Molly’s here, we don’t fight fair, my buzz big, like Lightyear
You ain't real, shorty, you can’t stand here
Molly’s here, we don’t fight fair, my buzz big, like Lightyear
You ain't real, shorty, you can’t stand here
My wrists rocky like A$AP, this a G mix and I laced that! FLOCKA!
Money can’t buy you love, so I don’t pay for no pussy
I don’t pay these haters no mind – so fuckin’ call me cheap
Money can’t buy you love, so I don’t pay for no pussy
I don’t pay these haters no mind – so fuckin’ call me cheap
And I don’t mean to throw no salt but these niggas small fries to me
And I’m feelin’ good, I’m lookin’ good, I’m smokin’ good, I’m sippin’
Got a party in my bedroom, that’s a party she ain’t missin’
Smokin’, drinkin’, no passin’ out
Molly’s here, we don’t fight fair, my buzz big, like Lightyear
Molly’s here, we don’t fight fair, my buzz big, like Lightyear
You ain't real, shorty, you can’t stand here
And I’m feelin’ good, I’m lookin’ good, I’m smokin’ good, I’m sippin’
Got a party in my bedroom, that’s a party she ain’t missin’
Got a party in my bedroom, that’s a party she ain’t missin’
I smoke a joint durin' an interview (Ugh)
We gonna make a big tsunami up in the joint
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain, G?
99 problems all gone in that one joint
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
Give Tadoe the joint he on it
Give Fredo the joint he on it
Give Tadoe the joint he on it
Give Fredo the joint he on it
I got a joint that'll knock your points off

Impari, spari e sbrani scarsi col metodo Stanislavskij
Venti morti e un machetero, sto nel Mato Grosso
È una pretesa prendo ciò che era già mio e mi ha tolto
Ho un disco d'oro in più e qualche amico vero in meno
'Sta vita 'n t' rà scelt nasci, vivi e muor
Fumo un petardo d'erba e rido sul tuo rap di merda
20 anni manco e sono stanco di st'ambiente
Fumo un petardo d'erba e rido sul tuo rap di merda
20 anni manco e sono stanco di st'ambiente
E nun è colpa mij, nun dic' ca so pessimist
O cor ch fa BOOM e simm e n'at munn
Nun c' pigliat chiù, a gioia mij è o stipendj e tutt a crew
O cor ch fa BOOM e simm e n'at munn
Nun c' pigliat chiù, a gioia mij è o stipendj e tutt a crew
Sto in altura ad un passo fra il tetto e la luna
Tre notti senza sonno e non ho ancora festeggiato
Non hai radici, sei solo un Puppets e un Mon Cicci
Profondi e tristi sulla faccia dello schermo
Me hago joias nuevas sacando sus muelas y sigo a rueda
Huevon, yo tengo hambre y no me quedo sin cena
Sopra le emozioni e con i versi t'infarto
Hombre tu sul palco rappi e abbassi lo sguardo
Sopra le emozioni e con i versi t'infarto
Hombre tu sul palco rappi e abbassi lo sguardo
E non ti piaccio però "Ahimè, c'ho stile"
Vi mettiamo in fila, flow da carabina, carica e fucila
Ogni fan delira e resta sorpreso
Vi mettiamo in fila, flow da carabina, carica e fucila
Ogni fan delira e resta sorpreso
Io ti gonfio il naso e sembri Cyrano
Bomba sempre e bomba in quantità, dappertutto
In cima alle pareti e le cartelle c'è 'sto nome
'Sta merda è droga e crepi senza, resti muto in penitenza
Rappo e le guardie esplodono come in Sentinel
Smeezy e los amigos con la droga silos
Viaggio Avatar: is the joint, nanana!

My flow spill with words you can’t pronounce, stories you can’t tell

Giro mezzo grammo in un joint
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
No camera, I don’t care who you are

Smoke kush, transport to the airport

Gon' put this joint between your lips
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here joint apart
Back on the scene, crispy n' clean
Back on the scene, crispy n' clean
While she listen to the oldie soap operas smoking bogies
Ashing her cigarette and a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight
Ashing her cigarette and a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight
Homie momma smoking with nothing to lose
Sitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded
What we gon' do see the local dope man
Todos andamos pelones y siempre fumando mota
Fumando la marihuana, pura kush en su joint
Y saca las caguamas y jala a la banda
Todos andamos pelones y siempre fumando mota
Y algunas son detonadas a la voz del rucón
El ruco es de familia y mafia como en Sicilia
No cree en eso de la Biblia con putas y cocaína
Y saca las caguamas y jala a la banda
Todos andamos pelones y siempre fumando mota
Todos andamos pelones y siempre fumando mota
Y saca las caguamas y jala a la banda
Todos andamos pelones y siempre fumando mota
Y algunas son detonadas a la voz del rucón

Puff told me, like, the key to this joint
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
The power pack in black, making cement crack
Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But I ain’t try to hurt her, ‘cause i’ve always been the best
Lit a few candles like my power hadn’t reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn’t reached
Lit a few candles like my power hadn’t reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn’t reached
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
The club popping but she ain’t trying go there
My money grown, baby, ain’t no need to see id
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don’t mind what you do
I just wanna watch, I ain’t taking time at you, dudes
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don’t mind what you do
I just wanna watch, I ain’t taking time at you, dudes
London on the balcony, we’re about to smoke another joint
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don’t mind what you do
This smoke's got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice, baby
This smoke's got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice, baby
See the joint blaz-on, somethin' smells amaz-on
Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
More bread than aisle G, then bag and scan me
Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
The molly wouldn't let the meds work
Ye and Hov getting into it over me, tryna do a joint venture
When my new joint hit, just can't sit
Smoke!
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Your last joint was six years ago
The strip joint veteran sits two away
Push 3 buttons I make the joint spin, Balrog (hey)
Where my joint at?
Lady G, Willy B in time

Having a coke fit, going through withdrawls daily
I’m not to joke with, bitch I don’t sell crack, I smoke it
Having a coke fit, going through withdrawls daily
Walking up in the cypher smoking, talking about “Who want it?”
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Tear the rest up, with every joint that I press up
Making you high off of the smoke, often you're cold
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Versamene ancora e ancora (No, no)
Ancora e ancora (No, no)

Ci sentiamo i pezzi e ridiamo di te (Squad)

Analgesici nella Fanta mentre fumi il joint (Rraaah)

I can’t tell when it happened
Shawty Lo said ‘Dey Know!’, I really didn’t
But I ain’t know what the fuck niggas was talkin’ bout
Unit kicked Game out, they ain’t give a fuck
But I ain’t know what the fuck niggas was talkin’ bout
Unit kicked Game out, they ain’t give a fuck
A&R’s won’t take risks, they won’t sign niggas
Now all the content is the same, it don’t differ
Some them they ain’t educated
Fuck blaming the south, we ain’t segregated
Some them they ain’t educated
Fuck blaming the south, we ain’t segregated
Was it when Ma$e retired? He couldn't hack it
And you really don’t know shit
I can’t front, I’m missing the old Clue tapes
Are we a business that we can’t afford to maintain?
Second week show that boy numbers ain’t high

I mean, some can’t stay afloat

The more niggas said they didn’t write down lyrics
The more it started to sound like they didn’t
The more niggas said they didn’t write down lyrics

Honestly, I ain’t know what to think
I can’t blame the fans for not knowing a damn thing
So when some shit comes that don’t fit the mold
It’s like mole and nigga you won’t even do Gold
So when some shit comes that don’t fit the mold
It’s like mole and nigga you won’t even do Gold
It’s like they can’t like more than one rapper at a time
And I ain’t believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me
If rap was alive, we’d be trying to be the best rappers ever
But you won’t get accepted at all if you ain’t street tough
It ain’t REAL no more
Songs don’t do it no more, the shit’s shocking
Seen it when “Lean Back” had the whole world rocking
Songs don’t do it no more, the shit’s shocking

Dope ass rappers ain’t seeing no dough
To some, it ain’t fun no more

I ain’t gonna lie, I was scared to death, straight up
I was like, “That ain’t true, it sounds desperate”
I don’t think it’s downloadin’ dog, the line’s tired
One dope single and a bullshit album
Timberland said they didn’t want black niggas wearing they boots
Had the kids trying to buy shit they can’t name
Our stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that ain’t even in
I can’t explain it, I don’t know what to tell ya
Mike Jones went platinum off of Slim Thug’s joint
We wouldn’t have to watch Flava Flav try to find his girl
If I ain’t know better, I would think that mix show is now programmed
It’s too simple, they can’t think we’re really deep
But that let a nigga know if we ain’t dead
Female emcees, they don’t ever hit the target
What’s up with Jacki-O, Rah Digga, that I can’t figure
And Trina ain’t been the same since Nan Nigga
What’s up with Jacki-O, Rah Digga, that I can’t figure
And Trina ain’t been the same since Nan Nigga
Some of us ain’t prepared for something so lucrative
Nigga you 95 years old motherfucker shouldn’t be a listener
Is that the reason Hip Hop itself ain’t centered?
Should see that they don’t know a thing about this rap shit
Runnin’ with entourages who act like they ain’t never left the projects
When J-Kwon told me he ain’t like Raekwon cause he stole his name
I doubt it, there’s just one thing they don’t understand
So we Kurt Cobain’d ourself and we’re defeated
I mean, I used to blame Reggaeton, I can’t front
Lil Mo said she ain’t get paid for "Put It On Me"

He's been doing coke, smoking weed, getting drunk all his life he's a shame
Everytime he lit a joint

Then I'm back up in that trap, slingin' crack it's real

Don’t know
I don’t like this beat
But they ours, sweet dreams, smoking sours, picking white
I’m sayin’ I don’t think I can live life this way
You are what you eat, but I swear, don’t push me
Hit you so hard, you ain’t even know what happened
And I ain’t trying to be another hoodlum, cruel and gruesome
Knew I’d be a big baller before I grew some

I could tell you what it is; I could tell you what it isn’t
Ain’t really asking for a lot
 into the cup where the D's won’t peep
My prodies roll something that you wish y’all had
Call it bags, before I couldn’t afford the hash
Niggas don’t want it cause I’m that flea type
They tried to pass me the livest blunt
Said, “How you ain’t gone just shine this way?”
They tried to pass me the livest blunt

Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley

Magari cambio stato e schizzo la tipa dentro
Meglio restare solo e darti una vita in grembo
Hai visto quanto è brutto il mare d’inverno
Ho paura di impazzire e andare fuori
Mi voglio ripulire e dare colpe alla droga
Ho paura di impazzire e andare fuori
Mi voglio ripulire e dare colpe alla droga
Io sono ottimista e ci piscerò sopra
E penso quando galleggiavo nella fogna con Georgie, ehi
Perso tra il nulla e l'addio
Ho scritto al Creatore e mi ha detto:

Bumpin´Sizzla, dank in the swisher, nigga, just one of those days
Addicted to match smoke and stuntin' on bad hoes
Dropping feces on these tracks, smoking loud, where my weed pack?

It’s cool but I don’t see them laughin' at my money though
I’m spinning gold out my records know you can’t combat me
They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
They let me lie to them and don’t feel like they’ve been misled
Makin' so much bread, I don’t care that they’re just being fake
It hurts me just to think and I don’t do pain
Lean in, let go
It’s cool but I don’t see them laughin' at my money though
Ze moeten je beseffen, en nu ben ik aan aan t staren
Ja we doen t samen

Ik voel me gezegend, ik dank God voor al die jaren

Ned survived by the slightest luck, he wasn’t a dead baby, Neddy was alive as fuck!
But God dammit, I can’t use your pity"
“That hand-walking lump-headed Yeti can’t speak”
He couldn’t stop, wouldn’t stop
And every night he’d watch ‘em dance through the glass
Of the club, and he’d wait there in line for his chance
And every night he’d watch ‘em dance through the glass
Of the club, and he’d wait there in line for his chance
But the bouncer said, freak, you can’t dance!

Ich bin ein Ausländer, ey, Bruder, leih mal ein'n Zehner
Du kommst nicht an unsre Tür, denn achtzig Schuhe steh'n im Flur
