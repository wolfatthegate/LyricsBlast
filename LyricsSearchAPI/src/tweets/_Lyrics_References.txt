I aint a rap dude im a dude who raps, before this i was sellin crack
I got gas ‚ and the coke I don't sell molly no more ‚
I don't smoke crack motha fucka I sell it!!!
5.Never sell no crack where you rest at.
I be where the coke and smoke at
Everybody's going to the cocaine castle
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
he loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Provider of the back drop music for the crack rock user
And since I cut the lean habit I been shopping like a bitch
who cares when it feels like crack 
Spillin lean on the Red carpet 
Got some lean in my cup  gas in my blunt  got some hoes who gon fuck 
Champagne  cocaine  gasoline and most things in between
